WELCOME TO CYNTACS

Cyntacs is a python-based code editor that offers various basic functions, such
as line numbering and (coming soon) syntax highlighting.

Cyntacs aims to be:

* a nice way to write code
* an easy-to-use text editor

Cyntacs does not aim to be:

* a full-fledged IDE
* a replacement for more advanced code editors such as visual studio code

Please report any bugs in the Cyntacs github repository
